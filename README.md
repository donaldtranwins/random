# MBoutique PHP

### Making a single-page site
>Using the MBoutique project we created in the root course, add PHP functionality to the website.   
>The goal is to make the original website a single-page site, and to dynamically create the menu in PHP.

I did not use my own MBoutique site; I used Erik's site because all 4 of his pages were responsive, as opposed to only 1 of mine was.
