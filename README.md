# AngularJS 
### Controllers
> Requirements were to add controllers on the input, functions to replicate your data on the DOM, and validation on the forms.
> Zero styling was required in this assignment.

My goal:
- Style this page, without using CSS.
- Use Bootstrap to dynamically display the validation from our Angular function calls.
- Use Angular models and $index to dynamically color the table using Bootstrap classes.
- Simply use Bootstrap more to learn more of its nuances.  
  - Specifically, in ways that Bootstrap was not probably not intended to be used.
